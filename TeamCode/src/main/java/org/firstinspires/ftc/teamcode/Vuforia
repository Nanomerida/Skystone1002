 /* In the following code, I have edited things to be able to use this with the Skystone vuMark. This is originaly meant for 
 * Relic Recovery (obviously), and some things still assumed the relic recovery trackables. I changed most of those to Skystone files,
 * like the data set used for loading VuforiaTrackables (if you are interested, it's in Skystone1002/FtcRobotController/src/main/assets,
 * under Skystone.xml. There are other Trackables there too for the pictures on the perimeter and the bridges, but the first one in the list is
 * the SkyStone vuMark.). I annotated certain things, which are usually the non-official looking comments. A few object names and 
 * stuff like that I have changed to make more relevant to Skystone. As for using this, it just needs to return an int or something with
 * 0, 1, or 2. We will need to make all of this a method eventually, and make sure the same vuforia libraries are imported in our code.

 * duplicate the core Vuforia documentation found there, but rather instead focus on the
 * differences between the use of Vuforia for navigation vs VuMark identification.

 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list.
